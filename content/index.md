I'm Satwik, a Data Science student at UC Berkeley. Currently working at [Advocate](https://tryadvocate.com) and [Exo Labs](https://exolabs.net/) as Machine Learning Engineer Interns.

In the past, I've worked on a variety of projects:
- Researched under the [Professor Prasant Mohapatra](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/mohapatra/) on the topic of [Double Momentum Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning](https://doi.org/10.47611/jsrhs.v12i1.3644).
- Worked on Noise-Resilient Federated Learning Models through Robust Aggregation Methods at the UC Santa Cruz SIP Program. Presented at the Sigma Xi Research Conference.
- Developed a multimodal extractor that uses NLP and Computer Vision to extract information from Mental Health Records, MRI, and other biomarkers to differentiate between Lewy Body Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease.
- Built a startup called Neigh â€” a two-sided marketplace for neighbors to rent and lend essentials to one another.

I'm interested in using foundational models to build better biological diagnosis tools through prediction of protein folding and protein-protein interactions. I'm also interested in startups, AI, philosophy, economics, and more.

On the side:
- I'm a massive Warriors fan (Go Dubs!)
- I love to read and write about practically anything
- I'm big into working out and staying fit
- I'm a conisseur of wildly vast musical genres

I've made it my goal to build and learn in public which is what I intend to do here. If you have any interesting recommendations, want to work on something together, or just want to meet reach out through [email](mailto:satwikp@berkeley.edu) or [twitter @therealsatwik](https://twitter.com/therealsatwik)!
